        <h1>Where is Dwaparayuga's Shyamanthaka Mani Today?</h1><br><br>

Theory #5 Syamantaka Mani was at Saurashtra's Somnath Temple where Lord Somnath, defying gravity, levitated

Legend has it that Syamantaka Mani inside the jyotirlinga helped with the levitation

In 1026, Mahmud of Ghazni not only plundered Somnath Temple but also mercilessly shattered the Shiva Linga

He committed the most atrocious crimes against humanity; mass killing of devotees, plundering, violence towards women etc

After restoration, Alauddin Khilji and his brother Ulugh Khan not only desecrated Somnath Temple but also built a mosque

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel spearheaded Somnath restoration in the capacity of Home Minister, hence the Statue Of Unity

Syamantaka Mani was never in Somnath's Shiva Linga; firstly because it is not capable of levitation

Our craftsmen ingeniously crafted a similar Shiva Linga at Chidambaram, which unfortunately vanished without a trace

Somnath's metalloid Jyotirlinga suspended due to magnetic levitation, counteracting the force of gravity

Ever since, many fairy tales came into being as Syamantaka Mani's journey was not mentioned since Akrura's acquisition

The other Gods & Brahma descended upon Earth pleading Lord Krishna to return as its been 125 human years since

Krishna forewarned the citizens of Dwaraka about the impending calamity and ascended to Vaikuntha along with Balram

Heeding Lord Krishna's warning, some left but the rest killed each other arguing before Dwaraka's submersion

Syamantaka Mani is capable of preventing natural calamities. Yet Lord Krishna forewarned about the submersion

Lord Krishna had Syamantaka Mani on Him as He left Dwaraka; hence the hint about the approaching calamity

Lord Krishna subsequently reached Somnath, which is 238km away from the modern-day Dwaraka

Lord Krishna then arrived at Bhalka Tirtha, a place which is about 3 - 4km away from Somnath Temple

Bhalka Tirtha was where Lord Krishna ultimately left His mortal body since being hit by the fowler with an arrow

Bhalka Tirth's Krishna with a wounded foot represents the bygone era. Although, in the end, Syamantaka Mani was not on Him

Arjuna or charioteer Daruka would've known if Syamantaka Mani was on Lord Krishna because of its gold-yielding power

There was no mention of the gem's whereabouts in Bhagavatam; it was not on Lord Krishna at the end of Krishnavatar

What happened between Somnath & Bhalka Tirth, then? Lord Krishna returned the gem to Sun God, its original source

Why didn't Lord Krishna consider leaving the gem behind, which was very much capable of safeguarding Dwaraka?

Lord Krishna was bound by the virtuous Gandhari's curse. Later, a chain of events led to the elimination of Yadava clan

Just before Dwapara Yuga ended, Lord Krishna returned the gem to Sun God with the approaching Kali Yuga

Kali Yuga cant endure the transcendental Gandeevam, Sudarshanam, Panchajanyam, Parijathatam, Syamantakam etc

End of every Yuga, all transcendental divine attributes should return to their respective abodes nonetheless

In Bhagavatam, transcendental attributes circumambulated the Lord. Vishnu Purana also mentions the return of Parijatham

The gem had to be returned although it was not documented. Akrura alone used it righteously for the benefit of humankind

With Akrura's demise and nobody just as selfless around, Lord Krishna thought it was wise to return the gem to Sun God

Transcendental divine attributes respond to the Supreme alone whereas Syamantaka Mani yields gold regardless of ownership

Given the bloodshed, Syamantaka Mani could claim more lives by Dwapara Yuga end, hence Lord Krishna returned it

Yogis firmly believe that Lord Krishna sent Syamantaka Mani along with Maitreya to the paradisaical land of Shambala

As instructed by Lord Krishna at the end of His avatar, hierarch Maitreya spearheaded the legacy of transcendental knowledge

To this day, Maitreya is considered the ancestor of the entire Yogi kingdom

Preparations are apparently underway in the paradisaical Shambala for the dawn of Kalki, the final incarnation of Lord Vishnu

Re-established dharma necessitates economical structure, hence Maitreya executed Lord Krishna's plan

Syamantaka Mani is either with Lord Surya or in the paradisaical land of Shambala; the rest is pure folklore
